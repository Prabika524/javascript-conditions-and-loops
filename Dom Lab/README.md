# DOM Lab – Task 1 & Task 2

## Project Title
DOM Manipulation Example

## Description
This project demonstrates basic **Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation** using JavaScript.  
It focuses on selecting HTML elements and dynamically updating their content through JavaScript.

This lab covers:
- DOM element selection
- Content manipulation
- Event handling
- Text length calculation

---

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

---

## Features Implemented

### Task 1 – DOM Selection
Different DOM selection methods are used:
- `getElementsByTagName`
- `getElementById`
- `getElementsByClassName`
- `querySelector`
- `querySelectorAll`

These methods are used to:
- Access headings
- Access paragraphs
- Update heading text
- Modify paragraph content

---

### Task 2 – Content Manipulation
- Paragraph text updates dynamically when the button is clicked.
- New text is **appended** instead of replacing existing text.
- Paragraph text length is logged in the console.
- Demonstrates use of:
  - `innerHTML`
  - `textContent`
  - `addEventListener`
